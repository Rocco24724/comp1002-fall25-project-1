            <h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
            <h3>"Speedee Service System"</h3>
            <p>Most restaurants are slow but not us we at McDonald's have our kitchen streamlined so well that food can be made much faster than the competition.</p>
            <h3>A Very Small And Focused Menu</h3>
            <p>Other restaurants offer dozens of different items but here at McDonald's we focus on only a few items to improve speed, consistency, and price.</p>
            <h3>Low Prices</h3>
            <p>Because of the efficient system we have and the small menu we are able to offer the cheapest prices with the fastest times.</p>
            <h3>Family Friendly</h3>
            <p>We at Mcdonald's make it a top priority to make McDonald's a familt friendly place by having bright colours and having cleanliness as a top priority.</p>
